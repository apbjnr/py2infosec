...     print "Cleanup code"
... 
no exception
Cleanup code

## handle specific task. mention name of exception caused.
>>> try :
...     a = 0/0
... except ZeroDivisionError:
...     print "Divide by Zero"
... except :
...     print "Unknown error"
... 
Divide by Zero

## detailed reason for exception
>>> try :
...     a = 0/0
